  Sick of your desk job? A new job site will help you find a new career as an
  urban farmer. Ponic Jobs has listings for everything from vertical farm
  managers to tree nursery directors, and while some require a fairly extensive
  background (a horticulture director position calls for "extensive leafy green
  experience within a greenhouse") others, like marketing roles, are an easy
  transition from other fields.
